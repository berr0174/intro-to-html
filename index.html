            <img src="images/me.jpeg" alt="Guy named Reda thinking he's confident and all but in reality he's not" width="500">

            <p>I'm Reda, a graphic design student who loves drawing and creating. I'm really into fashion, trying new things, and going out whenever I get the chance. I'm very obsessed with matcha and niche franchises for some reason, and I really hate clowns… which feels important to mention.</p>

            <p>I never actually planned on going into graphic design. I was originally interested in animation, so I took a preliminary program, drawing foundations, with that goal in mind. Though one thing led to another, and I ended up in this program instead. Surprisingly, I'm really loving it so far, even more than I think I would have loved animation.</p>
